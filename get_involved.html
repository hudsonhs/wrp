    Advocacy
  </h3>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-lg-12">
    <p class="lead">We collaborate and brainstorm with other WRP members in efforts to spread awareness of the refugee crisis both on- and off-campus. Past events have included film screenings, advocacy drives encouraging students to e-mail or call their representatives and support pro-refugee legislation, discussions at a local senior center, a panel at a local high school, and awareness panels at Wesleyan. Last year we also brought artist Angie Smith and her exhibit <a href="http://newsletter.blogs.wesleyan.edu/2017/04/27/wesleyan-refugee-project-hosts-panel-exhibit-on-refugee-resettlement/">Stronger Shines the Light Inside</a> to campus. Future projects will include bringing film screenings to local community centers with the Enough Project, hosting events with the Office of Muslim Life at Wesleyan, exhibiting a photo series in CHUM, and bringing relevant speakers to campus.

    Volunteering
  </h3>
  <div class="row m-b-1">
    <div class="col-md-6">Through creative events such as clothing drives, art shows, charity weekends, benefit concerts, food banquets, and t-shirt sales, the fundraising team works with other non-profit organizations dedicated to providing refugees with long-term support.
      In 2016, the fundraising team raised over $12,000 for the Jusoor Amal Fund in one week through an online platform.
      These proceeds will help fund the university tuition, living stipend, food, and transportation costs of a student living in Za’atari, the largest refugee camp in Jordan.
      Last year the team also raised $6,000 for IRIS and participated in its Run for Refugees 5K event.

    <div class="col-md-6">
      This semester we plan to partner with other organizations similarly focused on wellness and increasing access to education and other basic needs for refugees.
      If you are interested in event planning and managing, collaborating with other student groups to host events, and supporting organizations that are doing incredible work all over the world, consider joining our fundraising team!

        Paper Airplanes
      </h5>
      <p>
        Paper Airplanes facilitates English tutoring that links American college students with Syrian refugee students.
        Our tutors spend between 1-2 hours a week tutoring their student in English, SAT preparation, or other areas as the student requests.
        It's a great opportunity to make a new friend.

        IRAP
      </h5>
      <p>
        IRAP is the International Refugee Assistance Project (<a href="http://refugeerights.org">refugeerights.org</a>), an organization that provides legal assistance to refugees in the process of resettlement in the United States, Canada, Australia, and parts of Europe. Since its founding in 2015, WRP has worked with IRAP to help U.S. affiliated Afghan and Iraqi refugees complete their refugee and Special Immigrant Visa applications to the U.S. This year, WRP is helping IRAP research and write a report related to government inefficiencies in this application process. WRP is also helping IRAP conduct research related to refugee resettlement, highlighting the services, benefits, and organizations available to refugees resettling in all 50 states. In doing so, we hope to advocate for systemic change and provide support to refugees.

        Integrated Refugee and Immigrant Services (IRIS) is a refugee resettlement agency, contracted with the State Department to help refugees from Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Congo, Sudan and other countries resettle in the New Haven area. A team of 4-8 Wesleyan students are going to go to New Haven weekly to assist with IRIS’s Mommy and Me program.</p>
